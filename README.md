# Pine-City-Zoo-Re-Do
An app that aim to raise revenue and attraction to a zoo located at a small city called Pine City - School Project.

The app has a map as its home page, weather forecast and the feedback, for suggestions and complaints.

After learning JavaScript, I saw it fit to redo my projects, and this one was one of them.

Here I played around with CSS clip-path, styling the pictures to make them more interesting to at them.

Added the search bar feature - for the visitors to just search the animals and the places in the zoo, so they may not leave without seeing them all.

Working on this project, made me realise that I love styling more. And I am getting good at it.

Everything just makes sense now. 

Thank you FNB App Academy.

Thank you IT Varsity.
